The `lbd` (Lateral Boundary Discovery) tool in Kali Linux is used to discover subdomains and hosts that are related to a given domain. It is a powerful tool for reconnaissance and information gathering during security assessments or penetration testing.

Here's how you can use the `lbd` tool and some examples:

1. **Installing `lbd`**:
   - The `lbd` tool is pre-installed in Kali Linux. If you're using a different Linux distribution, you can install it using the following command:
     ```
     apt-get install sublist3r
     ```

2. **Basic Usage**:
   - To perform a basic subdomain discovery for a given domain, use the following command:
     ```
     lbd example.com
     ```
     This will display a list of subdomains associated with the domain `example.com`.

3. **Enumerate Subdomains**:
   - You can also use the `-e` option to enumerate more subdomains by querying various sources, such as search engines, certificate transparency logs, and other public data sources:
     ```
     lbd -e example.com
     ```

4. **Save Output to a File**:
   - If you want to save the results to a file, you can use the `-o` option:
     ```
     lbd -e example.com -o subdomains.txt
     ```
     This will save the discovered subdomains to the `subdomains.txt` file.

5. **Specify Custom Wordlist**:
   - You can provide a custom wordlist to use for subdomain discovery instead of the default wordlist:
     ```
     lbd -w custom_wordlist.txt example.com
     ```
     This will use the `custom_wordlist.txt` file to discover subdomains.

6. **Passive Subdomain Enumeration**:
   - To perform passive subdomain enumeration, which doesn't involve any active queries, you can use the `-p` option:
     ```
     lbd -p example.com
     ```
     This method is less intrusive and may be preferred in certain scenarios.

7. **Reverse DNS Lookups**:
   - To perform reverse DNS lookups on the discovered subdomains, you can use the `-r` option:
     ```
     lbd -r example.com
     ```
     This will resolve the IP addresses associated with the subdomains.

These are some of the common ways to use the `lbd` tool in Kali Linux. The tool provides a variety of options and can be tailored to your specific information gathering needs during security assessments or penetration testing.

LBD (LDAP Brute-Force Detection) is a tool on Kali Linux that is used to detect and prevent brute-force attacks on LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) servers. Here's how to use LBD and some examples:

**Usage:**

```
lbd [options] <LDAP_server_IP> <username> <password_list>
```

**Options:**

* `-h` or `--help`: Display help and exit.
* `-v` or `--verbose`: Increase verbosity.
* `-t` or `--threads`: Set the number of threads (default is 10).
* `-d` or `--delay`: Set the delay between attempts (default is 0 seconds).
* `-m` or `--max-tries`: Set the maximum number of attempts (default is 10).

**Example 1: Basic usage**

Let's say we want to test an LDAP server at `192.168.1.100` with a username `admin` and a list of common passwords in a file called `passwords.txt`.
```
lbd 192.168.1.100 admin passwords.txt
```
**Example 2: Using threads and delay**

In this example, we'll use 5 threads and a delay of 2 seconds between attempts:
```
lbd -t 5 -d 2 192.168.1.100 admin passwords.txt
```
**Example 3: Specifying the maximum number of attempts**

Let's limit the number of attempts to 5:
```
lbd -m 5 192.168.1.100 admin passwords.txt
```
**Output:**

LBD will output the results of the brute-force attack, including the username, password, and status (e.g., "success" or "failure"). If the tool detects a successful login, it will also display the LDAP server's response.

**Tips and considerations:**

* Make sure you have permission to perform a brute-force attack on the LDAP server.
* Be cautious when using LBD, as it can cause a high volume of traffic and potentially trigger security measures or alerts.
* Use LBD in a controlled environment to test your own systems or with permission from the system owner.
* Keep in mind that LBD is a detection tool, and it may not detect all types of brute-force attacks.

Remember to use LBD responsibly and within the bounds of the law.

The `lbd` tool, short for Load Balancing Detector, is a utility available in Kali Linux that helps determine whether a given domain is utilizing load balancing techniques. Load balancing is crucial for distributing traffic across multiple servers to enhance performance and reliability, but it can complicate penetration testing by introducing variability in responses from different servers.

### How to Use `lbd`

1. **Installation**: If you haven't installed `lbd` yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   sudo apt install lbd
   ```

2. **Basic Command**: To check if a domain is using load balancing, you can use the command:
   ```
   lbd example.com
   ```
   Replace `example.com` with the domain you want to test. The output will indicate whether DNS or HTTP load balancing is detected.

3. **Understanding the Output**: The tool checks for:
   - **DNS Load Balancing**: It verifies if multiple IP addresses are associated with the domain.
   - **HTTP Load Balancing**: It analyzes HTTP headers (like `Server:` and `Date:`) and compares responses from the server to identify load balancing.

### Example Usage

- **Detecting Load Balancing**:
   ```
   root@kali:~# lbd google.com
   ```
   This command checks if Google uses load balancing. A successful detection will show results indicating the presence of both DNS and HTTP load balancers.

- **Interpreting Results**: The output might look something like this:
   ```
   Checking for DNS-Loadbalancing: FOUND
   Checking for HTTP-Loadbalancing [Server]: FOUND
   ```

### Key Considerations

- When testing load-balanced systems, consider accessing them by IP address instead of the domain name, as this may yield different results. However, be cautious, as this could trigger security alerts on the target server [[2]](http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2017/06/07/lbd-kali-linux-tools)[[3]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kali-linux-intrusion/9781783982165/ch05s07.html).

### Conclusion

The `lbd` tool is a straightforward yet powerful utility for penetration testers to identify load balancing configurations on target domains, which is essential for accurate testing and reporting.
